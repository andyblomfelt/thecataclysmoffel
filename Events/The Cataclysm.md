The Catalysm is the name the general public uses for the bombing of the engine powering the mind sigil city of [[Leithe]]. This event set off a chain reaction that caused:
1. The city of [[Leithe]] to be completely destroyed
2. Overfilled the ley lines with magical energy

This overflowing of magical energy caused the other two sigil cities, Body and Soul (cities themselves are still unnamed) to also fall. While they are not completely destoryed (still need to determine what happened to each of them), their sigils were no longer siphoning magic energy, and magic was suddenly returned to the general population.
