Appearance: Gaunt and tense, runes on collarbones and hands, dressed in a rusted Paladin coat over salvaged armor
Vibe: Proud and exciting, the life of the party once he arrives. However, he can quickly turn serious if he is asked about his former power.

# Connections
- [[Ewan Reid]] Former subordinate and "chosen blade". Talric still believes Ewan can be saved—or reforged.
- [[The Saints]] Sees himself as their last servant. In truth, he's being influenced by lingering Saint-aligned magic or infrastructure.
- **Tiyeme:** Views him as a fellow believer, but might turn on him if their philosophies diverge too far.
- **Other Paladins:** Sees the surviving Paladins as fragments of a broken order—some must be recalled, others judged.
Ex-captain of the [[The Paladins of Calbraithe]].
