# Overview
Talric is the old captain of the [[The Paladins of Calbraithe]], granted the same power as the others by [[The Saints]]. He is loud, obnoxious, and the life of any party that he shows up to. However, he can quickly turn serious in a jarring way, especially when discussing his goals and conspiracies.
# Current events
After meeting up with [[Tiyeme Assisi]] at a local tavern in [[The city that Talric met Tiyeme]], he's currently wrecking havoc in the old [[Rebellion]] strongholds on the opposite side of the [[Mahaz Ridge]], interrogating people who he now blames for taking away his power. 
# Goals
- Regain the power he lost in the years after [[The Cataclysm]]
- Retake the palace of [[Calbrithane]] with the help of [[Ewan Reid]] once he shows him a restored power
# Connections
- Captain of the [[The Paladins of Calbraithe]], specifically of [[Ewan Reid]]. Thought he was the only one who could truly understand him, and was heartbroken when he left.
- Met [[Tiyeme Assisi]] at a tavern in [[The city that Talric met Tiyeme]], where he mentioned [[Some important NPC on a train]] that he thinks could be one of the Saints.
