Kylie comes from a small clan of dragon riders in the northern forests of the [[Eastern continent]]. Dragons are rare and not as powerful as is typical for a dragon due to the effects of the sigils, so most people wouldn't even know the existence of them.

While Kylie was riding on the day of the [[Cataclysm]], the leylines overflowed and surrounded her and her dragon with magical energy, combining their souls. Kylie thus became the first "dragonborn", a human-dragon hybrid. The status of the dragons are currently unknown.
