Originally born in [[Dalvareth]], and moved to [[Leithe]] since middle school to pursue academics.

Jerry was a student at the [[University of Leithe]]. His professor theorized about the the existence of magic and the leylines, and ended up putting together a paper proving it.

When the paper was going to be published, Jerry and his professor had it printed and read it over, only to find that they were suddenly unable to read the words they themselves wrote due to the effects of the mind sigil. His professor was labeled crazy by the university, and taken somewhere (likely by [[The Saints]]). Jerry became obsessed with figuring out the theory of magic on his own, in secret so that he wouldn't be silenced like his old professor.
