aliases:
  - Demiel

Originally born in [[Dalvareth]], and moved to [[Leithe]] since middle school to pursue academics.

When the paper was going to be published, Demiel and his professor had it printed and read it over, only to find that they were suddenly unable to read the words they themselves wrote due to the effects of the mind sigil. His professor was labeled crazy by the university, and taken somewhere (likely by [[The Saints]]). Demiel became obsessed with figuring out the theory of magic on his own, in secret so that he wouldn't be silenced like his old professor.

Demiel was born Elspeth Whym (Calbraithen), and Adrien Moreau (Cendrean). Faced prejudice throughout his life as a result of this lineage, and his parents business suffered.

In 699 AC, Demiel is taken to Leithe at the request of a woman with white hair and flowing academic robes. He did well on an aptitude test, and they showed up at his parent's door. His parents aggreed to send him in order to give him a better life away from his lineage that had hurt him and his family. Parents later moved to Port Almasha.
# Written backstory

14 years before the cataclysm.

(Age 11)

Growing up in Dalvareth, Demiel never quite fit in.

First, he looked different – while his mother (Elspeth Whym) was from Dalvareth, his father (Adrien Moreau) was Cendrean. Because of the ongoing war with Cendrevel, he and his parents (who were merchants) lost the trust of their neighbors over time to the point that business became quite difficult.

Second, he never had the best social skills and was just a bit too smart. In school, he always displayed enough aptitude to get praise from the teachers – he was nerdy and his family was distrusted, so there was quite a lot of bullying.

By the time he was a eleven years old, Demiel’s family was quite poor and he was very nearly friendless and socially outcast. Life was hard. Still, his family was loving and close, and they did their best to support eachother and pull through together. They had hope that Demiel’s aptitude would one day lead him to better opportunities, and his parents began working to save up whatever money they could to eventually leave Dalvareth, though it was his mother’s home.

At the end of each school year, an aptitude test was given to check the students’ progress. In addition to the local teachers and administrators, there was always an important looking man in a suit who came to town to proctor the exam. This year, however, a woman with white hair and long, flowing academic robes was also in attendance. She and the man in the suit whispered quietly to each other throughout the exam, and Demiel couldn’t help but feel they were looking and gesturing at him a bit too much. He distinctly heard the words “… off the charts…”.

Late that night as Demiel and his parents were eating dinner and winding down, they heard a knock at the door. His father left the table and returned a few minutes later followed by the man in the suit and the woman in the robes. They were holding a bundle of papers and appeared slightly put off by the dingy appearance of the Whym home.

“Demiel, these people would like to talk with you”, his father said.

5 years before the cataclysm 

(Age 20)

Demiel had been living and working at the Leithe Academy of Science for a long time, and he loved every bit of it. Today, he was finally graduating with his degree in science, and he could begin his real research career in physics with the famed Dr. Vidrial.

His parents agreed to send him away to Leithe to give him a better life – away from the bullying, discrimination, and poverty that had been his life. It also gave them to get their savings together to leave Dalvareth without an additional mouth to feed – a few years after he moved to Leithe, they had moved to Port Almasha, where their business as merchants was now thriving.

3 years before the cataclysm

(Age 22)

“I’ve never seen anything like this” Dr. Vidrial said after several minutes of pouring over the data that Demiel had handed him. “Did you check that the atmosphere had sufficient phlogiston?”

“Yes professor, I’ve been through it all about a thousand times – somehow, there is more energy coming out of the system than can be accounted for. Only by about one one-millionth of a BTU, but enough to be nearly certain that we are observing a previously unknown physical phenomenon.”

“Fascinating…”

2 years before the cataclysm

(Age 23)

Dr. Vidrial came to call the phenomenon “magic”. Demiel hated that he chose that term, not because it was inaccurate, but because, in hindsight, it lead to all of this pain.

After publishing their findings, Dr. Vidrial was quickly discredited and his career was destroyed. Demiel never quite understood why the backlash was so harsh. He knew that what they were claiming was bold, but also knew that their evidence (while small ) was strong. There was something in the universe besides the matter and energy that science was used to studying and, in theory, people should be able to use that something to do incredible things. Things that would make their current technology look like stone tools and that could solve all of society's problems and bring about piece.

The trouble was, outside of the extremely exotic conditions they’d created in the laboratory, it just didn’t work. Everything said it should. All of their models predicted that drawing the runic shape Demiel was now tracing should summon flames. But none of it seemed to work. They were missing something and they knew once they found it, it would change the world.

Unfortunately, that day never came. The day before Dr. Vidrial was supposed to speak about their findings in a inter-university symposium, the fire happened. Dr. Vidrial was presumed dead, and all of their findings were destroyed.

Cataclysm

(Age 25)

Things had gone a bit off the rails over the years since Dr. Vidrial’s disappearance. After the fire, he was given a place to study alongside a different professor who was willing to take him on after an evaluation period. Unfortunately, the work was boring.  He knew what he did next was a bit daft… he just went through the motions. Demiel knew that magic should work, and that something was missing, so on his own time, he kept experimenting.

He thought that maybe, the missing link to get magic to function had to do with the wielder, so he started making some modifications.

It started with the tattoos. At first in places no one would see, he started marking his skin with the symbols that his models predicted should amplify his access to magic. When it didn’t work, he kept going. It became a bit of an obsession, and within a few years, his skin was covered in flowing, runic tattoos. 

When his new advisor noticed this, he alerted the board and Demiel was expelled from the University for engaging in “pseudoscience” and harmful behavior.

In his apartment, his experiments continued. He realized that gemstones seemed to be linked to magical power, and that certain locations on the body were indicated (there was a lot of math involved). Next thing he knew, he had implanted gemstones in the skin of his forehead, chest, and points along his back, arms, and legs.

When a friend from University found out about this, he became concerned and reported Demiel, worried about the harmful and obsessive behavior. Demiel was taken into custody by the mental hospital on the University campus.

After a few weeks there, the Cataclysm occurred. Everything changed, and it turned out Demiel and Dr. Vidrial had been right.

 I want to leave this event open for some flashback role play and surprises, so I’m not going to write it out. Basically, magic suddenly comes online and because of his studies, Demiel is able to use it to survive the cataclysm, though he loses an arm.

8 years after the cataclysm

(Age 33)

In the years since Leithe was destroyed, Demiel had been unable to travel back to Port Almasha to see his parents. It took a long time for the refugees living near Leithe to get connected back to the rail-lines and to the rest of society.

Demiel recognized that his behavior had been obsessive and self-destructive, but did feel vindicated to some extent by the fact that magic did in-fact exist. He had become quite the expert in its use over the intervening years.

Unfortunately, while he and Dr. Vidrial were correct about almost everything, their work was unknown and unappreciated. 

He had spent the last few years as a refugee near Leithe. He eventually became a school teacher for the children of the refugees, helping them to understand physics and magic.

Eventually, he figured out how to use magic and technology to make himself a new arm, though it was quite faulty. He knew the magical studies of the rest of the world were leaving Leithe behind, but he felt a responsibility to stay and help the refugees.

Now, the rail lines were finally ready and he had enough money saved. He decided to leave the Leithe region and head back to Port Almasha, where he could finally see his parents again and potentially continue his studies of physics and magic at the university there, which was now the largest research institution after the destruction of the Leithe Academy of Science.
