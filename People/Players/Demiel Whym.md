Originally born in [[Dalvareth]], and moved to [[Leithe]] since middle school to pursue academics.

When the paper was going to be published, Demiel and his professor had it printed and read it over, only to find that they were suddenly unable to read the words they themselves wrote due to the effects of the mind sigil. His professor was labeled crazy by the university, and taken somewhere (likely by [[The Saints]]). Demiel became obsessed with figuring out the theory of magic on his own, in secret so that he wouldn't be silenced like his old professor.

Demiel was born Elspeth Whym (Calbraithen), and Adrien Moreau (Cendrean). Faced prejudice throughout his life as a result of this lineage, and his parents business suffered.

In 699 AC, Demiel is taken to Leithe at the request of a woman with white hair and flowing academic robes. He did well on an aptitude test, and they showed up at his parent's door. His parents aggreed to send him in order to give him a better life away from his lineage that had hurt him and his family. Parents later moved to Port Almasha.
