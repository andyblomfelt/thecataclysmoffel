Came from matriarchical society.
Ylva's line were the only ones allowed to do so. Ylva was never meant to be in charge. Her sister was sick, so she had to ask Hjordis to ride towards town.
Ylva went back to see if the clan was alive, and they were raided and died in a landslide. She found a relic of her people that's how her magic item.
Clan is about ~150 large.

Ylva was native to a small clan of women in the northern forests of [[Yarra]], who had been tending to the dragon [[Hjordis]] for centuries, since the ascension of the Saints. Ylva grew up to stories about her distant family saving Hjordis and offering her sanctuary in the forest, and how Hjordis would help the townsfolk by helping transport resources from Leithe over the mountains back to town.

Ylva was never meant to be close with Hjordis. Her older sister, Erri, was next in line to take the mantle of Vardmother, and would regularly train with Hjordis and learn the best ways to make sure she was fed, and the town could get the resources they needed. 

In 713 AC, the day of the cataclysm, [[Erri]] was sick, and so Ylva needed to take Hjordis in order to receive a shipment of medicine that was scheduled for the day. Ylva and Hjordis peak over the ridge to city a blue, crackling explosion slowly expanding over where Leithe should be. One of these magical cracks shoots out towards them, blinding both of them in a static of light. When they wake up, they're in a completely unfamiliar grassland, and heard Hjordis' voice in her head.

She spends the next two years trying to get back to her family. With the world in disarray after [[The Cataclysm]], it takes a long time to make travel happen. When she arrives, she discovers that the town was destroyed in a landslide. She is able to recover the sending stones that had been passed down in her family, now recognizing their magical potential thanks to the cataclysm's awakening.

In the years since, Ylva falls into a deep depression, and Hjordis wants nothing to do with it. She goes silent for the first time, leaving Ylva with a half dragon body and no home to return to. After a few years, they agree to work together to try to find a way to separate, so Hjordis can learn more about what's happened.
