Kylie comes from a small clan of dragon riders in the northern forests of the [[Yarra]]. Dragons are rare and not as powerful as is typical for a dragon due to the effects of the sigils, so most people wouldn't even know the existence of them.

While Kylie was riding on the day of the [[The Cataclysm]], the leylines overflowed and surrounded her and her dragon with magical energy, combining their souls. Kylie thus became the first "dragonborn", a human-dragon hybrid. The status of the dragons are currently unknown.

Came from matriarchical society. 
# Rumor
"They say was born of an elf and something that doesn't exist anymore. Dragons, maybe. Or worse. She doesn’t sleep, doesn’t bleed right, and can track a man through walls. Takes jobs no one else dares. One time, a village tried to cheat her. No one lives there now." "Aye, she’s been through here. Once. Maybe twice. Hard to say. You know it's her when the room goes quiet and the hearth gets livelier, like it’s dancing in her presence. Always in that heavy cloak, hood drawn low. Just enough light to catch those eyes — violet, like candlelight behind stained glass. Didn’t speak a word. Just left coin and a note for the job. Took it, did it, gone. Folk who try to follow her don’t come back. Folk who press her for a name get... unsettled. Some say she’s got horns under that hood. Some say there’s no face at all. Me? I say pour her drink, nod polite, and keep your eyes on your own business."
