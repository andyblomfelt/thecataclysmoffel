Taken under the wing of a leader figure in the order. Being groomed to be important in the village. Taken to a shrine and presented with a claw weapon. A moment of "you have succeeded, and you are rewarded with this". It's an ancient artifact connected to the leylines. End up sparring as a result. Final slash releases a wave of power that connects with the timing of the Cataclysm. Ends up killing the leader figure. Drew runs away out of guilt.

Person that took over leader position actually likes the character a lot. Helps Drew's character move on.

The order maybe has someone who can create the brands for [[Ewan Reid]]. Order is about 200-250 people.
