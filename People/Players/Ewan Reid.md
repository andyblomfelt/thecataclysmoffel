Doesn't want romantic/sexual plots for his character.

Born in 691 A.C. to [[Alastair Reid]] and [[Bonnie Reid]] in the township of [[Dalvareth]], under the stewardship of the Kingdom of [[Calbraithe]]. Ewan has always had his mother’s temper, but he was always interested in the lives and stories of others. His fascination and passion, along with rebellious instinct, made him very quick to latch on strongly to ideas and beliefs; a trait which made him very susceptible to the anti-[[French]] rhetoric of Calbraithen propaganda, much to his parent’s dismay. His parents had been born after the war had begun; they held no innate sympathy for the nation of [[France]], but they had hoped that their children would grow into a Calbraithe that knew peace. Ewan’s indoctrination would happen primarily within the walls of [[The Flimsy Fogbank]], a common hotspot for Calbraithen soldiers and idealogues. As he heard tales of the “monstrous” [[French]] soldiers and the “heroics” of his fellow countrymen, he began to staunchly cling to the ideals of Calbraithen superiority and [[French]] degeneracy.
# The Attack on Dalvareth
On one particularly foggy morning, a fourteen-year-old Ewan would find his opportunity to face the [[French]]. A small fleet of [[French]] ships would dock at the port of [[Dalvareth]] after [[French]] agents quickly and quietly secured the docks in the early morning. By the time the sirens began to sound, [[French]] soldiers had begun to sweep through the streets. Ewan’s father had already left for the forges earlier in the morning, as always; his mother had not yet finished readying [[Duncan Reid]] and [[Arabella Reid]] for school, and Ewan had not yet left to attend his apprenticeship at the [insert job]. His ears ringing with the sound of sirens and stories of heroism and glory, Ewan pilfered his father’s sword from his parents’ bedside and left his mother screaming on the cobblestones of Maker’s Row, cries swallowed by the mist as he sprinted towards the docks.

He weaved and dipped through alleys and narrow passages, moments blending together in a medium of adrenaline and fog until he found himself facing a squad of [[French]] soldiers, seemingly conjured from thin air by the twisting fog. He shakily drew his father’s sword, hands fumbling to find a steady grip on the handle as the soldiers called out to him and began to form toward him, weapons dripping with fresh blood. As they stepped nearly within Ewan’s reach, a wild slash was swept aside by the frontmost soldier, sword sent clattering to the ground between them. A sickening grin on the soldier’s face sent Ewan stumbling backward as visions of heroism fractured and were replaced in Ewan’s mind by realizations of powerlessness. Leather-clad knuckles sent Ewan spinning into the ground, and steel-toed boots cracked into his ribs. The beating was cut short, however, as a cry of pain from a soldier further down the alley heralded the arrival of Calbraithen militia. The soldiers turned their attention away from Ewan, and as his mind found a moment of clarity from the pain, it screamed out a single, instinctual command: run. Ewan grabbed his father’s sword, his Dad’s sword, and ran back the way he came.

Ewan’s mind raced. Hours passed somewhere between minutes and days in Ewan’s mind as he slowly made his way toward his family’s home, cowering in alleys and stoops to avoid the plague of soldiers sweeping through the streets as they quickly but methodically sowed death and destruction. 

As he peeked from an alley onto Maker’s Row, the fog had mingled with smoke and ash from the burning windows decorating the now-empty street. Ewan stepped slowly through the unnatural stillness, a picturesque vignette of lives recently lived, laborers and craftsmen slumped over in their thresholds, bodies laying a carpet of red upon the sidewalk. As Ewan continued down the block, breath held too long to count, a flickering glow grew brighter behind a curtain of fog. With each step, the light grew brighter and more defined, eventually giving shape to flames lazily spilling forth from the doorway and windows of his home. A body wearing his father’s boots and apron hung from a window on the second floor.
# Enlisting
2 days later, Ewan, covered in ash and mud, limped into a Calbraithen encampment in the hills to the south of Dalvareth. The dirt on his hands and under his fingernails betrayed that he had been digging recently, and his eyes stared far to the west, seemingly looking through the rocky hills and beyond the sea that lay on the other side.

Ewan would enlist in the King’s army, learning to wield weapons of war, how to put the weight of his grief and rage into his strike, how to stoke the flames of hatred to push himself further. His eagerness to fight and rebellious instincts caused friction with those of higher authority, often seeing him disciplined or punished for causing or otherwise engaging in extracurricular violence. One such incident placed him in the sights of a [insert title or rank] searching for subjects to be “redeemed” through [the grace of a Saint]. 

His body would forever bear markings of the purpose upon which he swore his life. A tapestry of interconnected shapes, symbols, scripts, and signs called “brands” sat upon his skin, blooming from a thick, intricate ring around the base of his neck. Encoded in the runes and symbols of the ring were the words from which he would draw unnatural strength, his oath: [INSERT ORIGINAL OATH HERE, something like “I give myself in service to the nation of Calbraithe. I will protect its people and its lands from its enemies. I will serve as its sword and its shield. Those who would act against us will burn in the flames of my swift and terrible retribution.”]. This newly codified purpose and power would bring with them the title of Paladin Reid. 

As a Paladin, Ewan would be trained alongside 8 others to become tactical specialists. Their brands would bestow them with various abilities, strengthening their bodies and minds, as well as allowing them to draw upon powerful, destructive magics. Ewan’s brands granted him the power of fire, allowing him to imbue his blows with roaring flames. He would be given armor and a weapon (a two-handed maul called [Inferno’s Call]), sanctified for his use as tools in his crusade.

[[The Paladins of Calbraithe]] would be a mere myth to most; legends that would supposedly crusade across the lands in and near Calbraithe, leaving only destruction and death in their wake. Few within the King’s army were granted the privilege of knowing the truth of their existence; fewer still would ever lay eyes upon them. 
# The Cataclysm
In the year 713 A.C., the world would be forever changed by [the Cataclysm]. Magic was let loose in the streets, economies collapsed, lives were upended, and societies were flipped upside down. Calbraithe was not spared from this fate, as many within the Kingdom were suddenly given reckless abandon to strike back against the perceived tyranny of the King. Many cities were overrun with revolts and riots, and the Paladins were summoned back to the capital city of [Caerbrithane] to protect the King and uphold order. When the paladins were ordered to strike down the revolting citizens, some obliged without mercy, while others were repulsed by the idea, seeing it as a betrayal of the spirit of their oaths. Ewan made his decision. (left intentionally ambiguous to be explored later).

In the aftermath of the revolt, the King was slain, his bloodline ended, and the nation-state of Calbraithe collapsed. [The Paladins’ oaths began to degrade as their oaths, while unique, all included the fundamental ideal of protecting the nation of Calbraithe. Under ordinary conditions, a broken oath would likely mean agony, degradation, or potentially death, but with the status of the oath so ill-defined, the resulting consequences were unpredictable. Adverse effects began to manifest among the group, with some seeing disfigurement or unexpected changes to their bodies; others would lose control over the release of their powers, magic consuming them.] Ewan would see his powers shut down completely[, and INSERT OTHER ADVERSE REACTIONS]. 
[INSERT STORY OF HOW OATH WAS AMENDED][NEW OATH INCLUDES “I will atone for my failures. I will do right by those I have failed.”].


Note on Oaths: Paladins’ abilities are powered by the dedication and commitment to their oath. These oaths are binding ideals agreed upon by the Paladin, and therefore actions carried out by the Paladin are considered to be in service to the oath if and only if the Paladin perceives it to be. A Paladin’s power requires absolute conviction to the ideals of their oath; if any part of the Paladin believes an action to be contrary to their ideals, taking such action will weaken the power of the oath, or, in severe cases, lead to retaliation from the oath. Breaking an oath for a Paladin generally results in severe consequences (often death), depending on the strength of the individual and the strength of the broken oath.
