# Overview
Captain of the [[Line Six]] crew. She was gifted a magical engine for her ship, the Line Six, that allowed her to collect draconic crystals for [[The Saints]] before the Cataclysm. Post-cataclysm, she works with [[Trusto's Gallery]] to gather artifacts from [[Milvenna]] for him to sell, and is currently working to learn where the artifact is that [[Layla]] was after.
# Current events
She has just returned from an expedition to [[Cendreval]], gathering information on [[Layla's artifact]]. Multiple people were lost, and she is going to pressure [[Trusto]] to either make the call to go after this thing or call it off as unattainable. 
# Goals
- Improve her magical engine now that the rest of the world is catching up to her
- Find the saint that made the deal with her, they haven't talked
