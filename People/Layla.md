An ex-professor of Archeology in Leithe, she moved away before the Cataclysm to Port Almasha where she met and eventually married Trusto. 

There was some artifact that she was after, hoping to understand more of the (unknown to her) draconic ruins she discovered on the island of Almasha a few years before she moved. She saw the writing on the wall with Dr. Vidriyal's research, and left on her own accord before anyone could become suspicious of her.

She fought in the revolution of Almasha against Calbraithe, using a sudden bust of fire magic that she was able to get access to. This saved the lives of many people, but killed her in the process.
