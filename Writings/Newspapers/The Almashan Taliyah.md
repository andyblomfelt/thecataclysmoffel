## ARCANUM TO HOST ANNUAL LICENSING EXAM IN TWO WEEKS
The Arcanum will host their 3rd annual licensing exam in 2 weeks, continuing a practice that began 3 years ago when the licensing system was introduced to Almasha. While general public opinion is unsure about licensing requirements, it remains the only opportunity to study magic and it's applications throughout The Port and greater Almasha.
