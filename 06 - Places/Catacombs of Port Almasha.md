Ancient temples worshiping the "Alm치ttki", constructed during [[The First World]]. [[Relne]] discovered these initially, and found [[Mirrathine]] tucked away in parts of it.

The catacombs contain murals and bits of text describing worship of the dragons. These are written in Ancient Common, a tongue that only [[Hjordis]] would know how to speak.

## Mural of the Old Keepers

Along the flat stone wall, old, crackled paint depsprately clings to the smooth stonework, coming together to depict what you can assume was once an incredibly detailed scene lost to time. The mural is divided into three distinct sections from left to right.

The left side shows a small city with an architecture style you recognize, the limestone and teal rooves being uniquely Almashan. Small boats surround the city, with intricately designed sails in an art style you don't recognize, but the patterns inside of them are mesmerizing in their own way. Many humanoid figures are painted around this city, completely out of proportion as to make the focus of the art the people there. You see them in various poses, some worshiping, some cleaning or reading. Below the "horizon" line of this scene lies a bit of text that you don't immediately recognize, but some characters are familiar enough that you think you could figure it out: *"The Seat of the Alm치ttki"*

The center shows a line of people copied one after the other carrying primitive backpacks, carts, and other things from the left side over to the right. You can deduce that this style depicts motion: a journey of people from the left to the right. You notice that many of them are looking up into the sky. Again, a bit of text lies beneath the "horizon" line, in the same language as the left: *"Rite of the Keepers"*

On the right, the same size as the city on the left, is a depiction of an open-air stone structure with a large opening in the center (similar to stonehenge). In the center opening, a single man is silhouetted against a painted yellow aura, raised off the ground line a few inches. The text below, in the same language: *"Blessing of the Alm치ttki"*

Above all three of these scenes, is a beautifully painted sky of yellows and oranges. In the places where brush strokes are preserved, you can see what must've once been an incredibly detailed showcase of clouds, sunrays and their reflections. This single sky must have been someone's life's work. Slightly off center to the right, you notice a stark black shape silhouetted against the sky: a dragon, wings outstretched, soaring into the beauty. Next to it, what looks like a rune similar to the one Ylva and Demiel were discussing earlier. *Show Odin's bind rune photo*

Spanning the entire top edge of this mural, is a line of text that's hard to read since it's so far up, adding a trim to the entire piece. You are able to pick out the centerpiece text, slightly larger than the rest: *"Isle of Frihelgi, Sanctuary of the Alm치ttki"*
