Ancient temples worshiping the "Almáttki", constructed during [[The First World]]. [[Relne]] discovered these initially, and found [[Mirrathine]] tucked away in parts of it.

The catacombs contain murals and bits of text describing worship of the dragons. These are written in Ancient Common, a tongue that only [[Hjordis]] would know how to speak.

- Large dragon flying through the rays of sunlight
- Bind rune of Odin next to the dragon
- Title on the right side: Isle of the Almáttki, the sacred Frihelgi
- Bottom section shows a landscape with people performing acts of careful cultivation. Tending crops, guiding water through channels, turning of the seasons, etc. Lines with runes eventually cultivate at a tree in the center vertically underneath the dragon.
