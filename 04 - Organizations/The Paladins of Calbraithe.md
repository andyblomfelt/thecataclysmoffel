A group of paladins led by [[Talric]], touched by [[The Saints]] and granted a small bit of magical power. Each member is branded with tattoos around their neck and collarbone, which temporarily disable the effects of the Soul Sigil to grant them access to fire magic. This had been tried on many people, and some just immediately died due to their limited magical potential. As a result, only problem recruits and those willing to sacrifice their life were assigned to this program. They acted as a "Black ops" division of the [[Calbraithen Army]] both pre and post cataclysm.

The group was made up of 8 members plus [[Talric]]. Currently, 6 are confirmed dead, one is unkonwn, two are alive ([[Ewan Reid]] and [[Talric]]).
