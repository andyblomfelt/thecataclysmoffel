Ancient temples worshiping the "Alm√°ttki", constructed during [[The First World]]. [[Relne]] discovered these initially, and found [[Mirrathine]] tucked away in parts of it.

The catacombs contain murals and bits of text describing worship of the dragons. These are written in Ancient Common, a tongue that only [[Hjordis]] would know how to speak.
