The largest port city in the [[Yarra]]. Not a sigil city, but definitely a hub of infrastructure, with a monorail system connecting the city. The city is surprisingly nice given how much chaos the rest of the world is in, and this is due to the influence of the wealthy traders that run the city.

Used to be controlled by [[Calbraithe]], and was one of the last places conquered before the fall.

It's getting more difficult to find runes in [[Yarra]] due to rapid industrialization. The Commerce Guild that runs [[Port Almasha]] limits the ability of adventurers and artifacts to come in from [[Milvenna]], since they saw what happened to [[Calbraithe]]. They are able to keep order due to, unbeknownst to them, a [[Dragon Artifact]] that allows them to *do something to keep the population and other traders in check, even when they have magical power*.

[[The Barons of Port Almasha]] want more free trade to open up between [[Yarra]] and [[Milvenna]], since people have heard that magical artifacts there are largely untouched. [[Line Six]] currently does expeditions into [[Milvenna]], but are starting to raise their prices and are frustrating [[The Barons of Port Almasha]].  Since [[The Barons of Port Almasha]] are some of the biggest buyers of Commerce Guild goods, they really can't keep them out of [[Port Almasha]], especially when one of the council people *is a baron or is heavily corrupted by one of them*.

# History
Port Almasha was once called "The Port of the Almighty" as translated today, pronounced back then as "Port Alm√°ttki". This was the home of one of the [[Dragon Sovereigns]] named [[Dragon Sovereign that lived in Ancient Almasha]]. There are temples buried under the current infrastructure worshiping this god.
# Post-Cataclysm
Only a few months after the Cataclysm, Port Almasha quickly drove out the Calbraithen occupation with the help of an armed citizenry, and a rogue saint sitting on the council of Port Almasha named [[Uriel]]. Fed up with the failure of [[The Saints]] to properly address [[The Rebellion]], she took control of the council of Port Almasha and issued a new system for keeping order in the city post-cataclysm:

Everyone currently living in the city, as well as anyone coming in, is required to wear bands around their wrist that becomes magically bonded on contact. These bands will suppress magic unless you have a license granted to you by the [[The Arcanum]], a collection of trusted mages by [[Uriel]]. The license system is added to build trust with the citizenry, but ultimately [[Uriel]] is the only one who can approve people who apply (so that she can make sure they can be controlled).

[[Trusto]] runs a business called [[Trusto's Gallery]], collecting artifacts lost to the ascension of [[The Saints]] long ago. Secretly, under the radar of [[The Arcanum]], he also sells magical artifacts to buyers smuggled in from [[Milvenna]]. [[Line Six]] is the main supplier, but he will also use other adventuring parties that he trusts in rare circumstances. Over time, [[Trusto]] and his crew have learned of a way to undo the magic built into the bands provided by [[The Arcanum]].

[[The Barons of Port Almasha]], a coalition of powerful crime lords throughout the city, occasionally meet to figure out a way that they can expand their businesses and retake [[Port Almasha]] for their own interests...
