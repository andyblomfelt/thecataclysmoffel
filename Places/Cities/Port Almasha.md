The largest port city in the [[Yarra]]. Not a sigil city, but definitely a hub of infrastructure, with a monorail system connecting the city. The city is surprisingly nice given how much chaos the rest of the world is in, and this is due to the influence of the wealthy traders that run the city.

Used to be controlled by [[Calbraithe]], and was one of the last places conquered before the fall.
