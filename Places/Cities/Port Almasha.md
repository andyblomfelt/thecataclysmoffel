The largest port city in the [[Yarra]]. Not a sigil city, but definitely a hub of infrastructure, with a monorail system connecting the city. The city is surprisingly nice given how much chaos the rest of the world is in, and this is due to the influence of the wealthy traders that run the city.

Used to be controlled by [[Calbraithe]], and was one of the last places conquered before the fall.

It's getting more difficult to find runes in [[Yarra]] due to rapid industrialization. The Commerce Guild that runs [[Port Almasha]] limits the ability of adventurers and artifacts to come in from [[Milvenna]], since they saw what happened to [[Calbraithe]]. They are able to keep order due to, unbeknownst to them, a [[Dragon Artifact]] that allows them to *do something to keep the population and other traders in check, even when they have magical power*.

[[The Barons]] want more free trade to open up between [[Yarra]] and [[Milvenna]], since people have heard that magical artifacts there are largely untouched. [[Line Six]] currently does expeditions into [[Milvenna]], but are starting to raise their prices and are frustrating [[The Barons]].  Since [[The Barons]] are some of the biggest buyers of Commerce Guild goods, they really can't keep them out of [[Port Almasha]], especially when one of the council people *is a baron or is heavily corrupted by one of them*.
