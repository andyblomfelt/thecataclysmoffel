# History
## Pre-Ascension (Before 0 A.C.)
In the ancient world, a group of monks carried to the island of [[Almasha|Frihelgi]] by Odin built a sizeable temple nestled into the southern point. These monks were tasked to care for the island as Odin's sanctuary, and as such they became a fairly self-sufficient order. They developed robust farming methods to take advantage of local geography, and became a common stop for traders coming from southern [[Milvenna]] and [[Dureya]] looking to bring their wares to [[Yarra]]. Many of these traders saw this stop as a requirement to enter [[Yarra]], paying tribute to [[Odin]] at the temple. As such, this small city quickly grew into a moderate trade hub known as *Port Almáttki* (Port of the Almighty).

## Ascension War (0 A.C.)
The island of [[Almasha|Frihelgi]] and *Port Almáttki* became the battleground in the Ascension War between [[Uriel]] and [[Odin]], an underhanded method on her end to attack [[Odin]] in his own sanctuary. Two spears were thrust into the island, one killing Odin in the north end of [[Almasha|Frihelgi]], and the other destroying the Temple of Odin directly in the Port as a symbol of power.

## Post-Ascension (0 A.C. to 713 A.C.)
With the sigils in place, the monks that once cared for Odin forgot their purpose of being on the island, and turned to what they knew how to do: service traders who continued to stop in the Port. Over time, the port grew as trade grew, especially with the legends of incredible shipbuilders and servicers at the port. As the old language of the First World died out, their terminology and tongue grew more similar to that of [[Dureya]]. *Port Almáttki* drifted to it's current name: *Port Almasha* over the duration of this period. The Almashan Commission was founded in Port Almasha, who quickly brought the rest of the isolated island villages under their control as the small island nation of Almasha.

A few years before the cataclysm, [[Calbraithe]] was continuing to rapidly expand to the north, and set their eyes on the now massive Port Almasha as a final goal. Calbraithe used what navy they had to begin attacking the specialized militia of Almasha, but quickly exhausted their resources fighting on two fronts ([[Cendreval]] to the north and Almasha to the south). Both sides were unable to make any progress in this war, and were in a stalemate for many years. To ease pressure from Calbraithe, knowing that if the confict with [[Cendreval]] ever stopped that Almasha would be the next target of the full [[Calbraithen Army]], the Commission made a deal with Calbraithe to annex them in exchange for a railroad line connecting them to the rest of Yarra's booming trade. While the citizenry wasn't happy with becoming Calbraithen, it did bring peace and quickly grew industry in Port Almasha. A new port was constructed to the north to support incoming train lines, the monorail was constructed, and the entire city saw a completely rework of their infrastructure. However, the heavy Calbraithen taxation to pay for these improvements left much to be desired by many merchants.

## Post-Cataclysm (713 A.C. to Present)
Almost immediately after the Cataclysm, Port Almasha saw a quick revolt by the militia to remove Calbraithe from their control and return Almasha to it's people. Many locals passed in the conflict, but the city remained mostly intact in the chaos since Calbraithe didn't have a strong military presence here (again, due to conflict with [[Cendreval]]). Professors and other inventors from [[Leithe]] who survived the Cataclysm made their way to [[The Arcanum]], a university looking to research magic that had been awoken from the spear of [[Uriel]]. For a couple years, things returned to relative normality in Port Almasha, with an increased risk of bandit activity now that magic had been introduced.

As a result of the Cataclysm, the seal keeping [[Odin]] at bay in the northern part of the island cracked, and [[Uriel]] quickly noticed. She made her way to Port Almasha and saw an opportunity to use the geography of the city to her advantage. Her magical power allowed her to quickly take control of [[The Arcanum]] by gifting the researchers magic they had never seen before, and she implemented systems that prevented magic casting without a license in the city. With the help of the Commission, who wanted to see a reduction in bandit activity, the city implemented a suppression band system that, unbeknownst to many, siphoned magical energy to [[Uriel]] so she could keep [[Odin]]'s seal intact.

Today, the city of Port Almasha thrives as a rare utopia, safe from the dangerous plains in [[Yarra]] and the wasteland that is [[Milvenna]]. Magic is used by those who are licensed to improve the lives of people there, and trade continues to boom as new technologies are discovered after the Cataclysm.
