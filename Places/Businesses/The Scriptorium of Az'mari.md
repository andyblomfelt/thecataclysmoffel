# People
[[Kireh Lanassei]] is a junior archivist, working closely with the small group secretly doing forbidden research at the Arcanum. She heard the update on the evening of Day 2 regarding Ylva's presence in the city, and will recognize her if brought into the Scriptorium. 

# Available information

## DC 10
- Calbraithe annexed Port Almasha during a war-time stalemate. The annexation came in exchange for rail development and military infrastructure.
- The workers, scholars, and regular merchants of Port Almasha rebelled and reclaimed independence shortly after the Cataclysm. The House of Almasha quickly took the side of the people, to make sure it didn't get out of hand.
- The island of Almasha, nearly 60 miles in length at it's largest, is home to a few smaller towns, mostly coastal fishing or inland farming settlements.
- The Arcanum is one of the oldest institutions in Port Almasha, originally a place of study and recordkeeping during the pre-cataclysm era. No information on B.A. (before ascension) years

## DC 13
- The north-western cliffs of the island were believed to hold pre-Ascension ruins, though most were cataloged as “structurally unsafe” or “archaeologically inconclusive.”
- Calbraithe repurposed old shrine foundations in the north for military signal towers during annexation.

## DC 15
- Old maps of the proposed monorail system show a line aiming for the northwest cliffs of the island of Almasha. Comparing it to existing maps of the monorail system, this extension seems to be the only thing that never got developed.

## DC 18
- A chicken scratch note in the margins says "The Keepers of the Father of Knowing will not be forgotten"
