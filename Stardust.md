# Stats
This iridescent powder is made from ground magical runes. Inhaling a dose floods the body with unstable magical resonance.
As a bonus action, you can inhale Stardust. When you do, the following effects apply for **1 minute**:

- Spell Surge. Your spell save DC and spell attack rolls increase by **+2**.
- Overcharge. Once during the duration, when you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose to cast it **at one level higher** without expending a higher-level spell slot.

**Side Effects.** When the effect ends, roll a d6:

| d6  | Side Effect                                                    |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | You gain 1 level of exhaustion.                                |
| 2–3 | You take 3d6 force damage as your nerves spark uncontrollably. |
| 4–5 | You are unable to cast spells for 1 minute.                    |
| 6   | No side effect—your body stabilizes the magic… this time.      |

You may only benefit from one dose of Stardust at a time. Taking another dose before the previous effect ends causes both effects to immediately end and triggers **two** rolls on the side effect table.
