# Plot
Guards enter the train and ask what happened. Seems done with his job. He gives a gold each for everyone to keep quiet so that the arcanum doesn't find out.

	- Mei can take a cart no questions asked, disguised, for 30 gold through customs. Noro knows this
- Tellers ask for reason of travel, place of origin, and ticket to enter.
