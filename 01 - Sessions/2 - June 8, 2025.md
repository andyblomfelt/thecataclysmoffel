## Train battle
Lunas is going to try to slow everyone down, and make sure his minions have a chance to try to separate the cars. Blink mages will try to disable everyone in the cargo car. If more people go down, they will try to escape back to the jeep and regroup.
## Loot
### Essential items
15+: 1 health potion
10-14: Stardust jar
### Gold table

## Stardust
Stardust is a ground up version of the crystals. You need a specific device to be able to do it, that Noro does not have access to in this moment. Trusto has one of these that he can make it, and there's a *second step* that allows it to be made into a drug. Noro has a stash of these in the station.
