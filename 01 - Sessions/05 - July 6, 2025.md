# Player Synopsis
The party wakes up at various times, and presume to meet down at Layla's tavern for breakfast, coffee, and a planning session for what to do to support Ewan's deal going down later in the morning. Ewan preps everyone that he just needs some support in case something goes wrong, and promises 20gp per person for their assistance.

Uvi takes care of everyone again, and brings over the daily edition of the Almashan Taliyah for the 8th of Hoster, which the players read and start to make plans around. Demiel is interested in going to the Arcanum and Scriptorium, especially with their exams coming up here in a couple weeks. Ylva and Noro are wanting to stay as far away from the Arcanum as possible, due to their own problems with authority, but Tiyeme encourages them that it might be worth it (seemingly to appease his deal with Mateo).

The party all go to the back warehouse of Trusto's Gallery, where Ewan's cargo is waiting to be delivered to Sorchan. Ylva and Demiel head up to a nearby rooftop, ready to help from the air however they can if something goes awry. Kaela and Sorchan arrive in a small jeep that can carry all of the crates Ewan provided. Kaela arrives with flamboyant energy, and Demiel & Ewan recognize her clothing as from the Western Nibo Empire in Milvenna. She introduces herself to everyone, and heads downstairs to meet with Trusto.

Sorchan introduces himself to Ewan, and heads inside to start accounting for all the cargo that they need to move. Ylva notices a collection of guards gathering in a nearby alleyway, and overhears them talking about arresting Sorchan due to concerns about those associated with the Scars of Calbraithe. The party sends a few private messages via sending stones and most retreat inside to protect the cargo, while Noro distracts the guards as they approach to make the arrest. Ewan runs inside to warn anyone inside about the escalating arrest outside, and finds Halur, who says he'll let them know and runs downstairs to where Trusto and Kaela are meeting. Tiyeme casts a message to the seemingly "captain" of the guard, saying that the dragon girl they're looking for is on a nearby rooftop (he told them a different one than she was actually on). The captain quickly disappears upon hearing this (to tell the Arcanum that someone is casting magic within city limits). Ewan comes outside and feigns drunk, talking about how "everyone always treats Calbraithens so shitty in this city." As he does this, the captain returns with another one and two Arcanum Watchers, and say that they want to bring Ewan in for questioning since the Scars of Calbraithe are a prime suspect in recent investigations.

Noro grabs a baton out of the enforcer's hand, and throws it back at one of the other captains while Demiel casts web as they reach for their weapons. Tiyeme uses a beam of light to incinerate one of the enforcers, quickly escalating the encounter. Blows are traded on the outside, scattering citizens and prompting reactions from enforcers and captains to restrain and arrest the party. Noro quickly scales a building to get behind one of the Watchers, while Ylva, Demiel, and Tiyeme throw magic from a nearby rooftop at the other enforcers. One Watcher is able to ascend away from the web and activate everyone's suppression bracelets, causing massive damage to the party.

As they recover from this action, the garage suddenly opens, and Trusto, Kaela, and Sorchan are all in the jeep that Kaela and Sorchan arrived in, seemingly ready to bold as soon as they get enough clearance from the door.
# Secret Synopsis
- Kaela tells Trusto about their most recent expedition and how many people they lost. She wants him to make a move for the artifact (by paying her and sending him some extra crew), or call it off as unattainable.
- Talric, after killing one of the guards investigating the area and injuring a few more, is set up at a small town nearby the wreckage of the Red Maw and is recovering until he can make his way to Port Almasha.
- Relne stayed overnight with his friends in the lower city, and was planning on returning to Trusto's Gallery today to do his job. He will arrive shortly after the conclusion of this battle.
- Mei left early in the morning to investigate the Red Maw, and is looking into where the wreckage took place and trying to find out who paid the Red Maw. She just figured out that the article in the Taliyah today is related to this attack, and that a third party may be involved (since Noro said they killed everyone in the Maw).
