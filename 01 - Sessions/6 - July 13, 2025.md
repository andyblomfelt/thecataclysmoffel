# Scenes
The garage door flies open, and Halur is pulling out in a jeep you don't recognize. The [[Shard of Mimir]] is exposed on the back. He pulls out into the street, and yells "Finish them off, Noro and friends! Once this activates we will be good to go."

## Ewan's Memory
The [[Shard of Mimir]] suddenly erupts in a wispy pulse of energy, a distortion of reality emanating as if the air had turned to water. You hear and feel the low hum of whatever primal energy this device is powered by.
As you feel this pulse hit you, Ewan, you feel a sharp, cold jolt that begins behind your eyes and spreads rapidly through your skull, as if this device is intruding on your mind. *Make a wisdom saving throw*. As this cold moves through your body, your brands suddenly flare with a phantom pain, as if the mark and your oath is being re-read and dissected. Your vision suddenly cracks, and through the cracks, you see a familiar sight.
