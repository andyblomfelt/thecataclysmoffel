# Session plan
Everyone starts out on a train from *somewhere* to [[Port Almasha]]. Each player has a different reason for being there:
- [[Ewan Reid|Ewan]] on the train to deliver weapons to [[Sorchan Varr]], a member of [[Line Six]]
- [[Tiyeme Assisi|Tiyeme]] on the train to follow the lead he got from [[Talric]] on [[Kaela]] and the [[Line Six]]
- [[Noro]] on the train to escort a high ranking merchant of the [[Thieves' Guild]]
- [[Jerry Howard]] to be determined
- [[Ylva]] to be determined

On the way, the train is attacked by a small bandit team called [[The Red Maw]]. Their leader, [[Lunas Verrin]], was paid by [[Talric]] to follow [[Tiyeme Assisi]] and apprehend some of his cargo since he spoke about [[The Saints]]. 

On the way, the train is attacked by a group of bandits that want to steal Tiyeme's armors. These bandits will at some point drop a coin that has the seal of the Calbraithen army. [[Talric]] paid them to steal Tiyeme's work, so that he can continue investigating The Saints.
During the fight on the train, [[Ewan Reid]] will get the opportunity to protect a helpless Calbraithen family, in order to rejuvenate his oath and desire to protect his people.
# Intro Monologue
The year is 721 A.C., or post ascension, and the world of Fel has been overtaken by magic long sealed away. The old Calbraithen empire to the northwest of Yarra, the eastern continent of Fel, has fallen at the hands of its people. A people that have lived through generations of conquest and oppression, when opportunity was gifted to them seemingly by the hands of gods, sought to get revenge. Since The Cataclysm 8 years ago, The Braithlands are nothing more than a faint echo of the once great empire. To the East of Calbraithe and across the arid grasslands and canyons covering most of Yarra's landmass we find the old city of Leithe, tucked away at the mouth of the Mahaz Ridge, nothing more than a crater carved into the mountainside. 
# Possible hooks
1. Sorchan is getting arrested once they arrive. A famous member of [[Line Six]], he's recognized by Tiyeme and Ewan. Everyone on this train, including their cargo, is being brought in for questioning and search.
