# Session plan
Everyone starts out on a train from *somewhere* to [[Port Almasha]]. Each player has a different reason for being there:
- [[Ewan Reid|Ewan]] on the train to deliver weapons to [[Sorchan Varr]], a member of [[Line Six]]
- [[Tiyeme Assisi|Tiyeme]] on the train to follow the lead he got from [[Talric]] on [[Kaela]] and the [[Line Six]]
- [[Selene Stormdancer]] on the train to escort a high ranking merchant of the [[Thieves' Guild]]
- [[Jerry Howard]] to be determined
- [[Ylva]] to be determined

On the way, the train is attacked by a group of bandits that want to steal Tiyeme's armors. These bandits will at some point drop a coin that has the seal of the Calbraithen army. [[Talric]] paid them to steal Tiyeme's work, so that he can continue investigating The Saints.
During the fight on the train, [[Ewan Reid]] will get the opportunity to protect a helpless Calbraithen family, in order to rejuvenate his oath and desire to protect his people.

# Possible hooks
1. Sorchan is getting arrested once they arrive. A famous member of [[Line Six]], he's recognized by Tiyeme and Ewan. Everyone on this train, including their cargo, is being brought in for questioning and search.
