# Session plan
Everyone starts out on a train from *somewhere* to [[Port Almasha]]. Each player has a different reason for being there:
- [[Ewan Reid|Ewan]] on the train to deliver weapons to [[Sorchan Varr]], a member of [[Line Six]]
- [[Tiyeme Assisi|Tiyeme]] on the train to follow a lead on [[Kaela]] and the [[Line Six]]
- [[Drew Renshaw]] on the train to escort a high ranking merchant of the [[Thieves' Guild]]
- [[Jerry Howard]] to be determined
- [[Kylie Howard]] to be determined

On the way, the train is attacked by a group of bandits that want to get at the high ranking merchant that Drew's character is escorting.
During the fight on the train, [[Ewan Reid]] will get the opportunity to protect a helpless Calbraithen family, in order to rejuvenate his oath and desire to protect his people.
