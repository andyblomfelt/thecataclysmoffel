# Session plan
Everyone starts out on a train from *somewhere* to [[06 - Places/Yarra/Almasha/Port Almasha/Port Almasha]]. Each player has a different reason for being there:
- [[Ewan Reid|Ewan]] on the train to deliver weapons to [[Sorchan Varr]], a member of [[Line Six]]
- [[Tiyeme Assisi|Tiyeme]] on the train to follow the lead he got from [[Talric]] on [[Kaela]] and the [[Line Six]]
- [[Noro]] on the train to escort [[Boding]] to Port Almasha to pay off a debt.
- [[Demiel Whym]] to be determined
- [[Ylva]] to be determined

On the way, the train is attacked by a small bandit team called [[The Red Maw]]. Their leader, [[Lunas Verrin]], was paid by [[Talric]] to follow [[Tiyeme Assisi]] and apprehend some of his cargo since he spoke about [[The Saints]]. These bandits will at some point drop a coin that has the seal of the Calbraithen army. [[Talric]] paid them to steal Tiyeme's work, so that he can continue investigating The Saints.

During the fight on the train, [[Ewan Reid]] will get the opportunity to protect a helpless Calbraithen family, in order to rejuvenate his oath and desire to protect his people.

# Other notes
- [[Boding]] has a compass that points towards [[Noro]]'s order, marking the location of the [[Stormdancer]] weapon that she accidentally killed her master with. This stone always pointed to it, but was only activated since [[The Cataclysm]]. 
# Intro Monologue
The year is 721 A.C., or post ascension, and the world of Fel has been overtaken by magic long sealed away. The old Calbraithen empire to the northwest of Yarra, the eastern continent of Fel, has fallen at the hands of its people. To the East of Calbraithe and across the arid grasslands and canyons covering most of Yarra's landmass we find the old city of Leithe, tucked away at the mouth of the Mahaz Ridge, nothing more than a crater carved into the mountainside. Refugee towns dot the edges of the crater as those who survived are desperate to find a new home, and protect their own against rogue magic users looking to take advantage of the collapsing world around them.

The world looked very different before The Cataclysm threw everything off course. People lived in whatever way made sense to them, and while life wasn't always prosperous, it was certainly simpler. Small orders and communities of dotted the forests to the east of the Mahaz, where people lived as they had for hundreds of years nurturing their own and preserving tradition. The conquests of Calbraithe gave inventors and businesses the chance to learn to work with metals and craftsmanship they'd never seen before, expanding trade and technology throughout Yarra faster than anyone could've anticipated. Before we knew it, cargo trains where taking goods between major urban hubs separated by mesa and grassland, and gave the Rebellion a chance to build against the powerful. Leithe was a prosperous academic city, where university research helped to create industrial technologies that helped those who could afford it. People came from all corners of the continent to study with professors in Leithe. Above all, The Saints. Most people had never met them, but their influence and miracles could be felt across Fel, since they obviously knew what was best for the people.

While the Cataclysm certainly sent The Rebellion, The Saints, and other nations and organizations spiraling in ways no one could've imagined, our story begins much smaller. We begin with the steady rhythm of a moving train, where the first signs of dusk creep through a gold-framed glass roof. *Roll a d20*. The somewhat peaceful air of the main seating car is suddenly broken by the pompous laughter of a small dwarven man dressed in golds and reds, happily reciting his plan once he and the others around him arrive at Port Almasha. In the booth behind this man, backs turned to each other, is Noro...

# Flashbacks
## Noro
You close your eyes, and when you open them again, you're surrounded by a familiar mist snaking it's way through the dense jungle around you. A sense of peace washes over you as you make your way through the mossy stone pathway up the mountain, a heavy pack of food weighing down your small frame. You look up, something you haven't done in years, and see a familiar face looking back at you as she grips your hand...
## Demiel
You close your eyes, and when you open them again, you're seated on the couch of a familiar home. The old wood fills your nose with a cozy cedar smell as you look at all the art-deco house around you. While not luxury, it's certainly the home of someone that cares about having a nice space, with pipes snaking in and out of the ceiling and wires holding up light bulbs giving off a soft glow to the space. An excited, shaking voice suddenly bursts through the door, and you see your professor burst through the door of his home that you're visiting...
## Ylva
You close your eyes, and can almost feel the wind in your face again as you remember a simpler time in your life. Your eyes open and are almost blinded without any clouds to cover the sunlight, as you look down to shield them and see a familiar friend supporting your weight. A deep, guttural, but friendly growl echoes through the sky. Where are you headed, what do you do?
## Tiyeme
You close your eyes, and when you open them again, the open sky of the low grasslands of Yarra overtakes your vision. As far as you can see, tall grasses up to your waist, tickling your arms as you step through paths you've travelled a hundred times. Smells that would send an ordinary man running are all too familiar to you as your cattle scream behind you. You recognize that you're only a few miles outside of Leithe. Go ahead and make an arcana check for me...
## Ewan
You close your eyes, and your ears are suddenly met with the memory of your people screaming in rage. When you open your eyes again, you're looking back on the palace of Calbraithe. The place you swore to protect. The people you swore to protect, storming its gates with the power only you were supposed to be gifted. Uncontrolled, sparking, unstable magic flies through the air as citizens of Calbraithe use their "gift from the gods" to fight back against their emperor. Talric screams at you from a few feet away, as he runs towards the palace "EWAN, WE HAVE TO GO". What do you do?
# Possible hooks
1. Sorchan is getting arrested once they arrive. A famous member of [[Line Six]], he's recognized by Tiyeme and Ewan. Everyone on this train, including their cargo, is being brought in for questioning and search.
