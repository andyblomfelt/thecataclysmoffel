## Tiyeme's Dream
Tiyeme: The world fades into darkness as familiar sleep takes you. Interrupting your peaceful rest, you notice a glowing orange drop of water manifesting in the distance, as if it's reflecting a sunset that you can't see. You watch this drop of water drip a few times, mesmerized by it's rhythm: drip, drip, drip, until it suddenly darts in a circle around you, cutting through the darkness of sleep and revealing an otherworldly scene, as if you're opening your eyes into this dream.

A thin layer of water stretches out past the horizon, disturbed only by your bare feet touching the surface. The sky is a beautiful pale orange and purple haze; the last breath of daylight stretched too thin. 100 feet in front of you, you see a tree without it's leaves growing impossibly out of this water. It's shadow stretches on for what seems like miles.

Make a perception check (to notice the owls on the tree). DC 10 to notice the owls.

As you walk up to the tree, you notice the familiar owl that has followed you since the Cataclysm opened your connection to the leylines. It sits on one of the branches, as if it's anticipating your arrival. Below this owl, the only other disturbance to the layer of water at your feet, lies a twin of your companion, lifeless and charred in stark contrast to the dreamscape around you. The living owl turn sto face you fully, and a voice, deep and worn like stone beneath a river, echoes not through your ears, but somewhere inside your body:

"You've named me wrong, child. But you still listened."

Make an insight check. DC 15
Success: Remembering Halur's words, the two magic systems that act as oil and water, makes you start to wonder what the source of this magic is.

The voice is familiar: the same one that you've only heard fragments of until today.

"I am the First Witness. The Father of Knowing. I gave my eye to the well of the dead and hung nine nights to learn the runes. I was the one they feared long ago."
"Bring Hjordis to me. In Frihelgi, where the sun goes to die, I will be waiting as I have for centuries."

As the owlâ€™s shadow stretches impossibly long across the white stone, the dream collapses. You wake with the weight of his words still echoing behind your ribs. As you open your eyes, you burst up breathing heavy, the intensity of hearing the voice in full whiplashing you back to reality. Anyone sleeping next to Tiyeme is woken by his sudden rise. You open your eyes only to find your vision working out of your left one. Anyone looking at tiyeme notices that his right eye is completely black. Over the next 15 seconds, it fades back to normal as Tiyeme catches his breath.
