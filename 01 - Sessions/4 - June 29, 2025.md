## Line Six
Line Six is purchasing a large collection of weapons from Ewan and his blacksmith to supply an isolated militia of the Scars of Calbraithe that have made camp outside of Cendreval. Their job is to bring this series of weapons to them, as well as retrieve *some artifact from Cendreval that Trusto needs*. 

# Plans
## Halur reacts to Ylva's news
The dragons are nothing but a myth. How do you know this 
## Tiyeme's Dream
Tiyeme: The world fades into darkness as familiar sleep takes you. Interrupting your peaceful rest, you notice a glowing orange drop of water manifesting in the distance, as if it's reflecting a sunset that you can't see. You watch this drop of water drip a few times, mesmerized by it's rhythm: drip, drip, drip, until it suddenly darts in a circle around you, cutting through the darkness of sleep and revealing an otherworldly scene, as if you're opening your eyes into this dream.

A thin layer of water stretches out past the horizon, disturbed only by your bare feet touching the surface. The sky is a beautiful pale orange and purple haze; the last breath of daylight stretched too thin. 100 feet in front of you, you see a tree without it's leaves growing impossibly out of this water, branches thicker on one side like a bonsai tree that's reaching for the sunset. It's shadow stretches on for what seems like miles.

*Make a perception check*
(DC 10) Success: You notice the faint outline of a bird sitting on one of the extended branches

As you walk up to the tree, you notice two owls awaiting your arrival. One is perfectly perched on the furthest outstretched branch, and seems to be the same as your companion that's been with you since that fateful day on your way to Leithe. The other lines below it, lifeless and charred, the only disturbance to the otherwise peaceful dreamscape you've found yourself in. The living owl turns to face to fully, and a voice, deep and worn like stone beneath a river, echoes not through your ears, but somewhere inside your body:

"Do you know me?" This voice is familiar: the same one that you've only heard fragments of until today. It's head tilts in anticipation of your response. *Wait for Tiyeme's response*

The owl suddenly lunges towards you, it's wings aiming to cover your eyes.

You feel the owl pull you backwards as if you're looking upside down, and when it removes it's winds, the scene is entirely different. You stand on an island of sharp, black rocks, no more than a quarter mile across. The smell of salt assults your nose as rough waves hit the edges of this jagged island. The moonlight peers through a cloudy, thundering sky and illunimates the center of this island, where a much grander tree than the one you saw before made of white and purple energy crackles with power. You can almost see the leylines moving through it, as if it's pulling power from the earth and returning it to the sky, the branches whisping out of existence. 

Peering into this tree, you see the same owl clutching one of the central branches, shaking as it tries to hold it's grip. It's left eye seems to have a massive injury on it, blood staining the feathers around it. The sky suddenly shifts as you can watch the sun rise, as if you're watching a timelapse. The sun sets again, replaced by the moonlight. 1. It goes again, 2. 3. 4. 5. You watch for 9 days as this owl hangs from the magical tree.

You suddenly fall over, opening your eyes and returning to the dreamscape you started in. You find yourself on your knees out of breath, hunched over the shallow layer of water, the tips of your white hair slightly damp and less kempt than ususal. 

"I am the First Witness. The Father of Knowing. I've waited a long time to speak to you, memokeeper. You carried my presence through the world, and for that I thank you."
"My voice tolls like iron in still water. If she hears it, I am lost. But, now that her shadow has joined yours, I can no longer wait.”
"Bring Hjordis to me. In Frihelgi, where the sun goes to die, I will be waiting as I have for centuries."

The sun suddenly sets, and the dream collapses. You wake with the weight of his words still echoing behind your ribs. As you open your eyes, you burst up breathing heavy, the intensity of hearing the voice in full whiplashing you back to reality. Anyone sleeping next to Tiyeme is woken by his sudden rise. You open your eyes only to find your vision working out of your left one. Anyone looking at tiyeme notices that his right eye is completely black. Over the next 15 seconds, it fades back to normal as Tiyeme catches his breath.

## Hjordis gets to look at the compass
Ylva, as you look more closely at this compass, you almost feel the presence of something looking over your shoulder, focusing all your energy on this thing. You notice the carving made into the gem with more detail this time: ᚦᚢᚱ. It's distincly different from the other gems you've seen Halur handling up until this point. The carvings on the others are primitive, while this seems to resonate with you in a familiar way.

"I recognize this writing. It's a lanauage I've long since forgotten."
You have a thought, not in your voice, as if Hjordis is speaking under her breath: "Could it really be that they are still alive?"
"We need to find more of the old tongue. I do not think anyone alive today would know it, but it might buried somewhere now that those monsters have loosened their grip."
"Record this rune. Copy it, make a relief, something. We aren't ready to see him yet, but we need to be ready once we are."
## Kaela and Trusto's meeting
- Only Kaela and Sorchan are coming to the gallery. Kaela is going to meet with Trusto, while Sorchan is going to meet with Ewan.
- Sorchan was told to find a man in a green cloak
- They are planning on bringing these weapons to a small branch of the Scars that have made camp outside of Cendreval. Sorchan doesn't love that they're going after a suffering people, but money is money and they need to fund their expedition somehow.
- They plan to leave in 1 week for Cendreval through the [[Emerald Sea]].
