# Concept
Mass teleportation for the entire world.
Does it happen regularly? Is it something that's only happened occasionally?
Somehow, this encourages society to build robust transportation. Magical trains that move people between locations. Safe locations that people need to go back and forth to? Or transportation systems to get people back home?

Who is responsible for these mass teleportations? A faction? An individual?

Someone did a mass teleportation to stop technology from advancing past magic. Why did they choose this instead of something else? Maybe they were trying to take magic away from people, and this was the side effect?

Have to go uncovering ancient tomes to understand magic again
# Concept 2
Rebellion against magical ruling class (celestial dragons). This causes outburst of magical energy that ruins peoples lives, but also grants magic to the population. Time skip happens, and we meet our people 20 years afterwards.
The people have learned to use magic like hextech, and there's cool shit like trains now. The ruling class still exists, but have sheltered themselves and haven't made a move in 20 years. Rebellion is building up to prepare?
