3rd of Morasir, 715 (~6 years ago)
The Council has suddenly shifted their position on the research I've been conducting with Halur and Mateo. The four of us have been studying this for years now, but I received word from the council today that we are being reassigned to new projects. Faruzan has never been directly involved in research like this. I don't know what his sudden interest in dictating our projects is about. At least I was reassigned to the Scriptorum, so I can at least go through their archives to the best of my ability.

I wonder if a third party is involved somehow. There was a girl being escorted around the grounds of the Arcanum last week that I didn't recognize. I wasn't directly involved, but noticing them guiding someone with the horns of a ram and a white hood into the central tower. I've worked with the Council for a long time, but I've never seen whoever this is before. Halur thinks I'm overthinking it, but I can't shake the feeling that they're somehow related.

21st of Scurrir, 715 (~5.5 years ago)
Halur and Mateo were asked to leave entirely yesterday. I had to back up the decision of the Council in order to have any sort of access to the records in the Scriptorum going forward. I've made too much progress here and in the lower temple to give that up now. I don't know what they did to get themselves in this trouble. I told them not to push the limits, that we don't know what's going on well enough to take any action yet, but knowing them it probably didn't matter. I just wish they would've told me. Halur went to visit Trusto. I don't blame him. With Layla gone, he could probably use the company. I'll work on creating a cipher so that the three of us can still communicate while I work from this position.

I don't know what's gotten into Mateo. He was always a little sleuthy, but to start distributing stardust to the general public? He's gone crazy. Calling himself a "consultant" to the Arcanum can't be a good thing, he wouldn't go back to them unless he needed something from them, and they wouldn't take him back unless they had something to gain from him. Whoever's running the Council now must have something on him. 

He reached out to me in the standard cipher saying he was close to finding a solution for [[Nila]]. He was always rash and reckless with his medical applications of Stardust, but I can't imagine what he's come up with this time. I can't get involved, I'm going to ignore his message. If you read this one day, Mateo, I'm sorry.

4th of Imir, 720 (~1 year ago)
Layla was right all along. I think there really is an ancient hidden temple in the northern part of Almasha. She and that one ship captain, I think it was the Line Six crew?, were always talking about how they couldn't find a way around due to some magical barrier. I didn't believe her at the time because magic didn't exist. I shouldn've known better after the Awakening. It might be worth finding this Line Six crew that she was so close with and seeing what they know about it. I don't know how I'm going to manage that from my position, but it's the only lead I have on her research anymore. What it has to do with what she learned about Calbraithe, I'm not sure.

7th of Hostar, 721 (Yesterday)
Did Kaveh really find someone with the face of a dragon at Dvarsya? I can't believe she made it into the city if it's really true, the Council would be all over that. As long as I can keep that a secret, then the Council won't know and I can make my move quicker. If she really is draconic, she might be able to translate the mural or any of the runes on these constructs. 

I'm so close to cracking the invisibility lens. Whoever this "dragon" is, if she's real, might be the key to making it happen. I told Kaveh to track her, but it seems like he fucked that up somehow. Maybe it's worth reaching out to Mateo in the old cipher.
