A now-fallen empire in the north-west penninsula of the [[Yarra]]. 

Sometime during the Second World, an emporer with Calbraithe's namesake wanted to spread his influence to the rest of the world, and overtook the entirety of the northwest penninsula. Since then, they've been at war with Cenreval to control the trade strait to the west.

After [[The Cataclysm]], the people revolted against the king (not the same as the emporer above). This king asked the Army and the [[Paladins of Calbraithe]] to act as riot police against it's own citizens, which eventually led to the storming of the palace. The empire entirely feel, and the lands once ruled by Calbraithe and now called the Braithlands, where old cities run themselves and take care of their own against people using magic for their own personal gain.
