# Replicator
## Features
Multiattack - The replicator can take 2 of the following during it's turn: Radial Sweep, Directive Blow x2, or Chain Beam.
Tripwire - If a creature intersects a tripwire created from Chain Beam or Connect take _Hit:_ 4 (1d4 + 2) damage. Make a DC 14 Dexterity. If fail, the creature's movement is halted.
Containment Pulse - Whenever a closed geometric shape is created using tripwires from Chain Beam or Connect abilities, all creatures within the shape must make a DC 14 Dexterity or Constitution. On fail, take _Hit:_ 13 (3d8) Thunder damage. If a DEX save is chosen, a success means no damage is taken, but the creature is considered prone. Failing the save takes full damage and knocked prone. If a CON save is chosen, a success means half damage is taken.
## Actions
Radial Beam - The replicator sends a beam of energy out in a 30 ft. cone in front of it. Creatures in this region must make a DC 14 DEX save. On fail, take 3d8 radiant damage. On success, take half damage.
Directive Blow - +7 to hit. On hit, 2d8 + 4 slashing damage.
Chain Beam - _Ranged Attack Roll_: +9, 60 ft _Hit:_ 17 (3d8 + 4) Lightning damage. On hit: Draw a tripwire between the caster, the target, and the next nearest Construct of the First World of any type. This tripwire will disappear at the end of the target's next turn.
## Bonus Action
Split - Create 2 replicates in any adjacent square. The replicates can take movement immediately.
Connect - Draw a tripwire to any other Construct of the First World. This beam does no damage outside of tripwire.
## Reactions
Phase Correction: When targeted by a ranged attack, swap positions with a connected replicate.
## Villain Actions
Invisibility: The replicator and all replicates become invisible for one round, and move to create new regions. At the top of the next round, use Connected Array with the new configuration. Players can notice devices on the wall that control this invisibility, which can be destroyed to reveal some of the replicates/replicator or revealed with an arcana check.
Recursive Loop Initiation: The Replicator revives up to two destroyed replicates and immediately uses Split.
