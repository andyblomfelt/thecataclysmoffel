# Replicator
## Actions
Multiattack
Radial beam: Spell attack in a cone
Directive Blow: Single target melee attack
Connective Burst: The replicator draws a line to a target, then to another replicate or replicator. The target, and any other enemies on that line are hit with a lightning spell attack.
## Bonus Action
Split: Create 2 replicates in any adjacent square. The replicates can take movement immediately.
## Reactions
Phase Correction: When the Replicator is targeted by a ranged attack, teleport to the opposite side of a replicate within 30 ft., swapping positions.
## Villian Actions
Connected Array: Create a region between the replicator and any number of replicates at the top of each round. If these regions already exist, spell attack against any creatures within it, as well as a save of some kind.
Invisibility: The replicator and all replicates become invisible for one round, and move to create new regions. At the top of the next round, use Connected Array with the new configuration. Players can notice devices on the wall that control this invisibility, which can be destroyed to reveal some of the replicates/replicator or revealed with an arcana check.
Recursive Loop Initiation: The Replicator revives up to two destroyed replicates and immediately uses Split.
