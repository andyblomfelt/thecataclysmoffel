![[Pasted image 20250605234412.png|left|300]]Son of [[Trusto]] and an active contributor to [[Trusto's Gallery]]. He was 17 when The Cataclysm hit, and when he watched his mother die in front of him. He quickly went to help the rebellion force [[Calbraithe]] out of [[Port Almasha]], and his father became overly protective of him as a result. He does not often get to go out and help [[Mei]] on her trips, and has never left [[Port Almasha]].
# Current events
Just broke up with [[Mei]] because he was too dead set on heading to the lower city constantly to do what he can against [[The Arcanum]]. Currently, he's continuing to go back and forth, helping local magical militias wherever he can. Almost got [[Trusto's Gallery]] outed recently.
# Goals
- Work on his magic in the lower city, where [[The Arcanum]] won't be able to see him
- Avenge his mother's death (whatever that means)
