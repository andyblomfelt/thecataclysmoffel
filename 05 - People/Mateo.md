Mateo is currently the main supplier of [[Stardust]] acrossed southern [[Yarra]], and a consultant to [[The Arcanum]] in draconic research. He worked out a deal with [[The Arcanum]] where he gets to continue his operation in exchange for his research on *some research that Uriel needs to finish Odin's seal, or something for Talric to be a vessel for draconic power*
# Appearance
Mateo is a man with refined, pointed features, exuding an aura of influence and control without being the center of attention. His short black hair is combed over to the left side of his face, barely touching his round sunglasses that shade his eyes even indoors. His chin comes to a noticable point, with a touch of dark, thin facial hair at the bottom. He is often found wearing a white suit with floral accents, to appear as if he's a part of [[The Arcanum]] without wearing the same "uniform" as licensed members.

He does not wear the standard suppression band that is typically required of citizens in [[Port Almasha]].
# Goals
- Have a conversation with [[Halur]] asking him to come help with his [[Stardust]] production, since he does miss him deep down.
- Complete a more potent version of [[Stardust]], that he might be able to use to resurrect his sister, without alerting [[The Arcanum]].
- Continue working closely with [[The Arcanum]] on draconic crystal processing, so they don't suspect him of doing other research.
- Present [[Ylva]] to [[The Arcanum]], so he might be able to free himself of his debt to them.
# Connections
- Worked as an apprentice of [[Halur]] before the change of leadership at [[The Arcanum]]
- Frequents [[Layla's]] hoping for a chance to talk with [[Halur]], but has never gotten the chance to
- Noticed [[Ylva]] dancing at [[Layla's]], and recognized that she might be a dragon. He thinks that bringing her to [[The Arcanum]] might free him of his captivity, and allow him to be pardoned and continue his business ventures on his own. 
- Spoke with [[Tiyeme]], and asked him to bring her to [[The Arcanum]] sometime on Day 3
# History
Mateo was originally born in a small town somewhere in [[Dureya]], where his family struggled for basic necessities. His sister, [[Nila]], travelled with him after their parents died as he tried to make a living for both of them. He became a little bit of a scam artist, getting involved in some less-than-savory crowds in order to provide for him and his sister. While [[The Cataclysm]] did not directly affect their life, it did somehow give [[Nila]] a disease that he didn't recognize. When she died, he had a magical dream of her reflecting in water, and is convinced that the magic granted to the world can bring her back.

After this vision, he stowed away on a ship headed for [[Port Almasha]], where he went to try to study magic so he could find a way to get back to her. He met [[Halur]], and they quickly bonded as Mateo learned from his research. He was taught about draconic crystals, and eventually worked together to create the first prototypes of [[Stardew]]. Mateo immediately started realizing the potential of this on darker markets, being a child of poverty and less-than-solid morals, while [[Halur]] was having none of it, focused on how he could use it to help *solve the research [[Layla]] was after.* For the rest of their time at the arcanum, their relationship grew apart, as Mateo began distributing the dust and refining it, hoping to eventually get enough data to make a version that could resurrect his sister.
