# History
Layla was once a professor of Archeology in Leithe. Before the Cataclysm, she discovered *some secret about Camael and the Paladins of Calbraithe*, and moved to Port Almasha to try to study this more away from the prying eye of some of the Saints. In Port Almasha, she eventually meets and marries Trusto, and works closely with Halur, Mateo, and Ziri to uncover an artifact related to Camael in Cendreval.

Once the Cataclysm occurred, she realized that she could no longer wait to find this artifact. She left a note to Trusto saying that she will need to leave, and not to look for her. The day she disappeared, the revolution of Port Almasha against Calbraithe went down. Trusto presumed her dead, while she actually managed to dodge the chaos in a flurry of untrained fire magic that Relne happened to see. She made it onto Kaela's ship, where they both made a daring escape from the city.

Relne and Trusto both presumed Layla to be dead in the revolution, but both still are holding out that she might be alive somehow, since a body was never recovered.

She has since been travelling with Kaela and Line Six, never making an appearance in Port Almasha and always staying onboard the ship. She was currently left behind after a daring escape from an ancient site in Cendreval, with Kaela and Line Six trying to figure out the best way to get her out of wherever she is.
