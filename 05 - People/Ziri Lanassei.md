# Appearance
![[Pasted image 20250704162343.png|left|300]]Ziri is a defined woman with sharp, stereotypically "masculine" features. Her short, white hair matches the white robes of the Arcanum, accented by the blue earrings that dangle from her ears. Soft, blue eyes make her seem approachable, despite a more cold demeanor that she tries to carry.

# History
Ziri and her family are from a river town in southern Yarra called Sarmagh, a little known hub of medical knowledge regarding herbs, medicine, and other arts for mending the body and spirit. They maintain extensive botanical gardens and began exporting some of their creations at the end of the Second World.

When Ziri was in her early 20s, her and her father moved to [[Port Almasha]] after it's annexation to [[Calbraithe]] because *insert reason they moved here*. Ziri and her father ran a physician's practice for many years up until the Cataclysm, and her father was off on a journey back home when it hit.

Ziri had gotten admission to study at the Arcanum just before the Cataclysm, and has been waiting for her father to return ever since. Immediately after the Cataclysm, she saw new plants and herbs grow much stronger with the new flow of the leylines, and came to a great reverence of them over time. Since Uriel's takeover, however, she's noticed a sharp decline in the natural herbs of Almasha that she's been collecting, and wanted to learn more about this correlation.

Ziri *found something that clued her into the dragonic language*, and is now trying to uncover it without the knowledge of the Arcanum. She's slowly found other sympathizers within the organization, and is now leading covert research efforts to decipher the language.

# Current events
- Was told of Ylva's arrival by the unnamed port authority guard that scanned her, since he recognized her as somewhat dragonic and had been working with Ziri thus far. Ziri now knows of Ylva's presence, and is working on how to contact her since neither she or anyone else that's working with her were able to follow Ylva.

Ziri is an archivist at the Scriptorum, working closely with the small group secretly doing forbidden research at the Arcanum. She heard the update on the evening of Day 2 regarding Ylva's presence in the city, and will recognize her if brought into the Scriptorium.
