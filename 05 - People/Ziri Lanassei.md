# Appearance
![[Pasted image 20250704162343.png|left|300]]Ziri is a defined woman with sharp, stereotypically "masculine" features. Her short, white hair matches the white robes of the Arcanum, accented by the blue earrings that dangle from her ears. Soft, blue eyes make her seem approachable, despite a more cold demeanor that she tries to carry.

# History
Ziri and her family are from a river town in southern Yarra called Sarmagh, a little known hub of medical knowledge regarding herbs, medicine, and other arts for mending the body and spirit. They maintain extensive botanical gardens and began exporting some of their creations at the end of the Second World.
