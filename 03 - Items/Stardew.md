A distilled form of [[Gems]] that is used by those at [[Trusto's Gallery]] to smuggle magic items into [[06 - Places/Yarra/Almasha/Port Almasha/Port Almasha]]. This works because magic from [[Gems]] and more traditional magic do not interact, and can blur the signature of another.
# Method
1. Raw [[Gems]] are ground using rare metals. Produces *Raw Stardust*
2. Combine *Raw Stardust* with saltpeter, silver ash, and oil from a plant called Blue-Moon Weed. Gently heat in stages. Results in *Pure Stardust*.
3. Distill *Pure Stardust* with the solvent *[[Mirrathine]]*. This results in *Stardew*.
# Stat block
Stardew
*Alchemical liquid, rare*

This translucent, textureless liquid is the final alchemical distillation of Stardust, suspended in a magical solvent called [[Mirrathine]]. When applied, it vanishes into the surface, leaving no visible or tactile trace.

As an *action*, you can apply Stardew to a creature, object, or item of clothing. The substance must remain undisturbed for 2 minutes to fully soak in and activate. If the target moves, takes damage, or is submerged during this time, the effect fails and the Stardew is wasted.

Once activated, the effect lasts for **1d4 days**, or until it is dispelled. While active, the following properties apply:
- **Spell Concealment.** Spells cast by or through the coated creature or object cannot be detected by _detect magic_, _identify_, _divination_, or similar magic.
- **Aura Suppression.** The magical aura of the target is hidden. Magical detection requires a successful DC 25 Arcana or Perception check to notice anything unusual.
- **Undetectable Casting.** Spells cast from the coated creature or object produce no visual, auditory, or magical signs, unless the spell specifically states otherwise.
