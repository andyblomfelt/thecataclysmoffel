# Effect
120 ft. range. Takes 10 seconds to activate, and requires one character to spend their action activating the device. On activation, any number of targets within 120 ft. will have their memory of anywhere between 10 seconds and 1 minute completely removed, as determined by the activator (I barely know her). 
# History
## Origin
It's a piece of the thing that powered the [[Mind Sigil]], originally a piece of [[Mimir]], harnessed to power the [[Mind Sigil]] after being defeated by [[The Saints]]
## Creation
[[Orion]], a member of the [[Rebellion]] that conducted the raid on [[Leithe]] before [[The Cataclysm]], stole a piece of the shard as they escaped after the attack. He was able to hold onto this and escaped to the eastern coasts of [[Yarra]], where he worked with other rebellion sympathizers to construct this device and understand it.
Why did they have someone smart enough to construct this device? What was their history?
## Acquisition
How did Trusto/Kaela discover the existence of this thing?
What was the mission like to retrieve it?
