## Boarding the Line Six
#### [[01 - Sessions/Plans/08 - July 27, 2025\|Session 08 - July 27, 2025]]
[[05 - People/Players/Ylva\|Ylva]], [[05 - People/Players/Noro\|Noro]], Tiyeme, and Demiel barely jump onto the [[04 - Organizations/Line Six\|Line Six]] as it pulls out into the waters surrounding [[06 - Places/Yarra/Almasha/Port Almasha/Port Almasha\|06 - Places/Yarra/Almasha/Port Almasha/Port Almasha]], making a break for the caves at the base of the cliffs under [[04 - Organizations/The Arcanum\|the Arcanum]]. [[05 - People/Kaela\|Kaela]] lets the group know not to go anywhere they shouldn't as they make their way, and she looks visibly stressed compared to her usual aloof demeanor.

Tiyeme asks to learn more about the name of the ship, and Kaela brings them back to the engine room where she shows off a [[03 - Items/Mirrathine\|Mirrathine]]-powered engine with six inline pistons. Now with a moment to breathe, [[05 - People/Kaela\|Kaela]] starts sizing up the group, asking their professions and skills. She eventually reveals that before everything went down, she was considering hiring the crew to help with a couple of runs she needs to make, one up in [[04 - Organizations/Cendreval\|Cendreval]] which she didn't reveal more details for, and pulls out the compass [[05 - People/Players/Noro\|Noro]] retrieved for [[05 - People/Trusto\|Trusto]]. She doesn't have time to do both, and needs to replenish the crew she lost on her most recent job. 

As the storm rolls in over [[06 - Places/Yarra/Almasha/Almasha\|Almasha]], the group takes a brief moment of calm, resting before whatever lies in the caves. A small conversation between [[05 - People/Kaela\|Kaela]] and a much deeper voice can be heard in the center rooms of the [[04 - Organizations/Line Six\|Line Six]], saying that she lost everything and that "they" might be their only chance.
## Ewan and Relne's Move
[[05 - People/Relne\|Relne]] leads Ewan down through the main entrance of the temple, checking to see if the tide has pulled in enough for them to escape. After traversing a few caverns and pools of water, they eventually make their way to another room of the temple that [[05 - People/Relne\|Relne]] seems familiar with. A workstation and chalkboard suggest that someone has been doing some kind of work here. Ewan takes his time and peeks at the artifact on the table, a yellow-tinted stone with runes and an ebony, lens-like gem in the center, and a journal thrown on the floor, as if someone had recently collected whatever other items were once on this table. Ewan skims the journal, and notices a cryptic note fall out of the back page, along with a second, smaller note with a few circles.

Ewan throws a firebolt as stone shifts behind them, but isn't able to break through the barrier. As he turns around to see the source of the shifting stone, a floating stone construct made up of ancient stone carvings, floating spears and shield-like structures form a pyramid shape, as it seems to "lock on" to Ewan with a strange, alien whirring noise.
## Reunited
![Catacombs of Port Almasha.jpg|right|300](/img/user/08%20-%20Utilities/Photos/Catacombs%20of%20Port%20Almasha.jpg)The four stand on the edge of the [[04 - Organizations/Line Six\|Line Six]], as rain pelts their clothes and encourages a speedy retrieval. A brief swim brings them to the mouth of a stone archway, damp from the recent high tide. The group traverses the cave for about twenty minutes, taking a few turns between open cavern and carved pathway before hearing sounds of shifting stone from deeper inside. The group sees light at the end of a smaller tunnel, and after shimmying through a small crevice, jump into a larger room, seeing Ewan facing off with this otherworldly construct.
## Fight Against the Constructs
The fight kicks off with chaos as the construct splinters into smaller pieces and floods the room with arcing lightning. [[05 - People/Players/Ylva\|Ylva]] drops an entangle spell to lock the core down while [[05 - People/Players/Noro\|Noro]] barrels through the interference, holding the pulsating pyramid down with a violent grab on one of it's appendages. Ewan hurls the artifact he found into the fray and follows up with a pair of hammer hits, demolishing a nearby replicate. [[05 - People/Relne\|Relne]] fires off a line of intense fire, dagger arcing with flames, while calling out that the wall units are the key to shutting the system down. Demiel tucks into a corner and fires off a Lightning Bolt, slamming the main construct as Tiyeme ignites his quarterstaff with a flaming strike. The Replicators retaliate, shifting positions and launching a wave of electric attacks that singe the team and reestablish their links.

The party splits to disable the network. Ylva fires off a Zephyr Strike and rains arrows into the connections. [[05 - People/Players/Noro\|Noro]] surges through the lightning field, barely dodging blasts as she carves into the core. Ewan plays whack-a-mole with teleporting constructs, using Divine Smite to obliterate a replicate mid-swing. Demiel fires a Shocking Grasp to finish off another before sprinting to cover. Tiyeme launches an overcharged Guiding Bolt that completely deletes a target mid-charge. 

The constructs suddenly vanish into invisibility. A shimmer takes over each one individually, as they all disappear and start to reposition. Noro quickly locates all six nodes that [[05 - People/Relne\|Relne]] mentioned earlier and hurls the pyramid into one, revealing a construct mid-hover. Ylva unleashes a radiant breath attack that wipes out two buttons. Demiel firebolts another. Tiyeme throws on the Red Maw gauntlet and smashes a control unit. As the invisibility collapses, the constructs surge one last time. Demiel takes a massive hit, but Tiyeme keeps him up while Ewan slams his hammer into the core of the construct. [[05 - People/Players/Noro\|Noro]], seeing her friends taking a beating, forces her way through arcing lightning, jumping into the air and grabbing one of the drill-like spears, spinning and slamming the replicator into the ground and smashing it into pieces. The last replicate is shattered by Tiyemeâ€™s final bolt, and with the field down and the room quiet, the group catches their breath, having barely survived whatever these constructs were.
## Investigating the Temple
![Pasted image 20250711231955.png|right|300](/img/user/08%20-%20Utilities/Photos/Pasted%20image%2020250711231955.png)In the aftermath, while Demiel is reading notes on the chalkboard where someone was obviously studying whatever these constructs were, the group reunites and questions Ewan about what actually happened. After learning about the dragon mural, a small group heads back into the large chamber where Ewan appeared to get a look at it, especially Ylva who perked up at the mention of a dragon. Hjordis, surprisingly, speaks up upon seeing the mural, and mentions her husband who she had forgotten.
