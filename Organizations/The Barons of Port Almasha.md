# Kaela & Line Six
Line Six is a crew of six people led by [[Kaela]]. Before [[The Cataclysm]], their uniquely fast ship was able to cross the center line of the world faster than anyone, and avoid the blockades set up by [[Cendreval]] and [[Calbraithe]]. Because of this, they were often hired to transport important people from [[Port Almasha]] and other important port cities to [[Milvenna]]; sometimes government officials and even criminals. Their knowledge of the center line of the world makes them invaluable for getting artifacts from [[Milvenna]] today.
