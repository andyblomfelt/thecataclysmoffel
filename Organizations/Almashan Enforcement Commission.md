The Enforcement Commission is responsible for preserving order throughout Port Almasha and the greater island. They often work directly with [[The Arcanum]] to enforce rulings, but are not provided magic, as this is reserved for licensed members of The Arcanum.

Officers are led by [[Anun Tighnari]].
