A mercenary group led by [[Kaela]]. Their ship (unnamed), was the first ship to run off magical energy during the Second World, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. No one was able to figure out how this crew could get around so quickly, and fight back so strong against any blockade or ship encounter.

Line Six is a naval crew of six people led by [[Kaela]] that conduct expeditions in [[Milvenna]] for magical artifacts and run them to [[Port Almasha]] and other ports in [[Yarra]].  Their artifacts are usually bought by [[Trusto]] out of [[Port Almasha]].
