The Saints are a group of magical elites that have spent their lives siphoning the magical energy of the world to fuel their own immortality. 

During [[The First World]], they infiltrated governments to construct cities that would prevent the general population from accessing magic. Once completed, they powered up each sigil (Mind, Body, and Soul), and "Ascended" to the status that they held since. This marked the start of [[The Second World]].

During [[The Second World]], they held positions of near godhood over the world. They performed occasional miracles of magic, and made deals with local governments to prevent humanity from advancing too far and learning about what they were doing with magic. One of these was trying to stoke rebellion in the [[Calbraithe]] empire by giving them a small elite force of magical soldiers, in order to get the leader to push his luck and cause rebellion. However, the expansion of [[Calbraithe]] with the help of the [[Paladins of Calbraithe]] led to the industrialization of the [[Yarra]]. A few of the saints left [[Leithe]], where a few of them lived and the home of the Mind Sigil, in order to address the expansion of [[Calbraithe]], which gave [[The Rebellion]] the opportunity to attack what they learned about the sigil encompassing [[Leithe]], and thus causing [[The Cataclysm]].

Since [[The Cataclysm]] and during [[The Third World]], the Saints have gone into hiding. It's unknown at this point what they're trying to accomplish.
